| April 5       |    9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| December 3rd  |  11 - 11:50  |                          I found the 30 most common words in Alice and Shakesphere and saved them to an array that way I can save them as smaller values example "the" can be saved as 1 which will make the size a lot smaller. Begun to write the actually while loop of taking in words |
| December 3th  |  9:30-10:30  | Finished writing the loop for taking in words. At first I was putting in words at a time then I realised it would probaly be easier to use chars so now I'm trying to do one char at a time. My compression alg current'y doesn't compress capitals so I'm trying to think how to fix that |
| December 4th  | 10:30-11:30  |                                                                       Worked and finshed the expand. After testing the code kept saying I was reading from an empty stream even though my while loop is only suppose to run while the so I think it has something to do with my word maker |
| December 10th | 12:45 - 1:45 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Worked on changing my text compressor. It seems to work |
| December 11th |     9-10     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Still some bugs in the compressor, so made some small changes to fix it |
| December 11th |    10-11     |                                                                                                                                                                                                        Started making text expander. Finishd Text expander but I have a null pointer error |
| December 12th | 10:05-10:40  |                                                                                                                                                                            Got help from mister blick figured out how to fix the null pointer, but still need to account for the edge case |
| December 12th |   11:30-50   |                                                                                                                                                                                                   after having Mr. Blick explain what the edge case is successfully solved the problem set |
