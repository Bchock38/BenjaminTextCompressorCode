| April 5      |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| December 3rd | 11 - 11:50  |                          I found the 30 most common words in Alice and Shakesphere and saved them to an array that way I can save them as smaller values example "the" can be saved as 1 which will make the size a lot smaller. Begun to write the actually while loop of taking in words |
| December 3th | 9:30-10:30  | Finished writing the loop for taking in words. At first I was putting in words at a time then I realised it would probaly be easier to use chars so now I'm trying to do one char at a time. My compression alg current'y doesn't compress capitals so I'm trying to think how to fix that |
| December 4th | 10:30-11:30 |                                                                       Worked and finshed the expand. After testing the code kept saying I was reading from an empty stream even though my while loop is only suppose to run while the so I think it has something to do with my word maker |
